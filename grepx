# 
# Ex: Find all matches with pattern "r" in all files found under a subdirectory "first" with filename end with 'bb'
#  grepx r first *bb
# 

if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: grepx <pattern> <subdir> [<file>]"
  exit

# get the length of the current working dir to trim it from the realpath
# The -P is to make sure the path is the physical path, so that it match the realpath called in find -exec later
pwd=`pwd -P`
# echo "pwd: $pwd"
len=${#pwd}

# cut -cN, N start index is 1, so need len = len + 2
((len+=2))

# trim the last / in the directory
dirpat=`echo "$2" | cut -d'/' -f 1`
#echo "dirpat: $dirpat"


dirlist=`find . -name "$dirpat" -type d -exec realpath {} \; | cut -c$len- | xargs`
# echo "dirlist: $dirlist"

  if [ "$3" != "" ]; then
    grep --color=always $1 `find $dirlist -type f -name "$3"` /dev/null
